In the same year, in conjunction with other artists and architects, he founded the CASMIPAC (Circle of Alberto Sartoris, International Movement for a humanistic Presence in Constructed Art). With MADI artist Angelo Giuseppe Bertolio, Bocca worked on a series of architectural projects which were the fruit of collaboration between artist and architect, such as the building in Soresina used for bowling and the extension to the Genivolta Cemetery in Cremona. Bocca subsequently carried out in-depth research on geometry in the works of Francesco Borromini. Following this, and white the starting point of research conducted by French priest Father Sébastien Truchet, he explored the infinite compositional possibilities generated by the division of a square by its diagonal. This led him to the work of Giorgio Scarpa and o models of rotational geometry and observations on bionics, in particular the structure of the mouth of a sea urchin, and to a collaboration with Giuseppe Trogu (lecturer in design at San Francisco State University) for a reinterpretation of Scarpa's Aristotle's Lantern for the 2014 international "Living Machine" conference in Milan. He has given talks at national conferences "Giorgio Scarpa's transformable objects: geometry as Art, Science and Play" in Castel Bolognese (Ravenna, 2015), "The legacy of the great masters" at the Alberto Manzi Centre in Bologna (2016) and "Encounters with Mathematics" at Castel San Pietro Terme (Bologna, 2017).  He took part in the conference of SMIT, the International Society for Medical Innovation and Technology, in Self (2016). He is author of the book "Soresinateatro", the fruit of his historical research and concrete involvement following the decline of the nineteenth century Teatro Sociale in Soresina. Bocca explores the expressive potential of paper, creating sculptures achieved by folding sheets on the diagonal.He is a member of the Astractura artistic movement, adhering to the fundamental principle that line is the minimum and irreducible element for the construction of a work of art. Bocca has recently exhibited his works in the town of Nocera Inferiore as part of the collective show "Astrattismo Ecumenico", in the Latina Biennial of Contemporary Art, in the collective show "Experimenta, dialoghi astrattisti" in Orta de Atella (Caserta) and in solo shows in the cloisters of the San Domenico complex in Crema, in Cremona's Art Gallery and Town Hall, and in the Priamar Fortress in Savona.He collaborated with the sculptor Paolo Mezzadri in experiments on the expressive potential of iron and paper in the exhibition "Dialoghi" (Cremona, 2016). He produced thirty  pencil and ink drawings for the Pulcinoelefante publishing house to illustrate the thirteenth-century text the "Three Character Classic". He has a work on display at the European Community's Joint Research Centre in Ispra (Varese) as part of the exhibition "Art Spaces. Nuclear Decommissioning: the science at the service of the future generation". He has a triptych on permanent display in the Museum of Geometric and Madi Art in Dallas (Texas).
