#### From the exhibition catalog:

The exhibition 'Femininity in Geometric Abstraction' is, I hope, just the beginning of a new focus on the art of geometric abstraction in Serbia in general. I organized and prepared the exhibition without any institutional or financial support from the Republic of Serbia, excluding the Modern Gallery Lazarevac, which recognized its value in its concept. Abstract art shows even today, more than a hundred years since it was discovered in the form that history of art recognizes as an aesthetic and conceptual unity, the potential for infinite exploration. All the works of the artists who participated in this project testify to this. I see no reason whatsoever why my efforts in its development and promotion should end with this exhibition, and I take this opportunity to already announce the plan to develop this exhibition into a biennial event of geometric abstraction art.

In previous decades, there has been no systematic effort in our country to identify and present the contribution to this branch of abstract art specifically by female artists. This is what primarily motivated me to develop and implement such a project. I am sure that the works of the seventeen artists, presented individually but with a unified expression, testify to an extraordinary creative energy that we can recognize as a whole despite all the differences in individual sensibilities. I believe that this is sufficient motivation for future gatherings and research in the direction that this exhibition has only outlined. That is also the reason why, in this introductory consideration, I avoided all attempts at aesthetic-conceptual classifications, theoretical analysis, even superficial systematization. I believe that the participants of this project and their works are eloquent in this sense by themselves, and that the theoretical discourse of contemporary Serbian geometric abstraction will naturally evolve from further efforts in gathering and communication. I hope that I will have the opportunity to witness this development in the future.
